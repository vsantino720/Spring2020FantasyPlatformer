This project is a 2D platformer inspired by classic arcade games such as Gate of Doom and platformers such as Castlevannia. This is 105Dev's first attempt at a platformer within Unity 2D, and we are extremely excited to become more well versed in using C# in conjunction with all that Unity has to offer. There are high hopes for the end product of this platformer, and stretch goals are as follows:
- Add support for local multiplayer with multipler player characters available
- Add support for LAN multiplayer
Apart from these we expect the game to have at the very least 10 full levels, and at least one final boss fight."
