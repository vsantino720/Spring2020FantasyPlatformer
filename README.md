This project is a 2D platformer inspired by classic arcade games such as Gate of Doom and platformers such as Castlevannia. This is 105Dev's platformer within Unity 2D, and we are extremely excited to become more well versed in using C# in conjunction with all that Unity has to offer. There are high hopes for the end product of this platformer.

The following are gameplay images:
